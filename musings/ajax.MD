ajax/xhr comes from the browser. They are shot off from the javascript on the page. They are the first building block of a Single page app, cause they avoid page reloads.
React and Vue and Angular and jquery are all built on top of this concept.

Without the browser shooting off queries from the javascript on the page, there is no dynamic web app...
