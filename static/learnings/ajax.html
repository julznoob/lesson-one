<h1>What is AJAX?</h1>

<div>
    <p>ajax/xhr is a request fired from the browser. They are shot off from the javascript on the page. They are the
        first building block of a Single page app, cause they avoid page reloads.</p>

    <p>React and Vue and Angular and jquery are all built on top of this concept.
    </p>
    <p>Without the browser shooting off queries from the javascript on the page, there is no dynamic web app...</p>
